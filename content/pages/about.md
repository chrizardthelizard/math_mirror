Hello, My name is Chris Blais. It's nice to meet you! I am a Postdoc who loves doing math with python.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a sytem integrator for food and pharma. Essentially, I did IT for factories. Generally this required PLC/HMI programming, spinning up servers for factory information management, configuring and troubleshooting hardware like pumps, sensors, switches, etc. 

In grad school, I primarily worked on simulating things. I became an expert in reaction mechanism generation and reactor simulation, specifically for heterogenous catalysis. My PhD thesis involved optimization of parameters within such reaction networks, using Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. A paper about this can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c05107)

In my current life, I have tried to combine these two specializations. I am particularly interested in new ways to optimizing sensor networks, in light of their observability, redundancy, controllability, etc.
